Password is a hash password for basic auth.  It can be generated by

htpasswd -n <username>

Enter your password and the hash will be printed.  Take that hash and place it in the
password field of your new user object.

e.g. htpasswd -n rebar

Digestpassword is a hash password for digest auth. It can be generated by

touch tmp.file
htdigest tmp.file Rebar rebar
# Get hash from file and put in the digestpassword field of your new user object.
rm tmp.file


Capabilites are how much the user can do.
Currently there is a single legacy capability.  "ADMIN" - this will make the user an 
admin user.
