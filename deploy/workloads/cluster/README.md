Multideploy README
==================

Copy the files in this directory to create more deployments.

The code assumes that you've created a ~/.dr_info file (http://digital-rebar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/install/dr_info.html?highlight=dr_info) to supply your cloud credentials.  It also assumes that you'll follow the [name]-provider patterh.

Usage

--admin-ip (required) targets a Digital Rebar server

--destroy (optional) will tear down the clusters
