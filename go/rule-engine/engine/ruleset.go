// Rule defines a set of Actions to perform if the Matchers match.
//
// Fields of interest:
//
// EventSelectors: a slice of EventSelector that determines which
// incoming Events this Rule should be triggered for. A Rule can be
// triggered by multiple Events, and multiple Rules in a RuleSet can
// be triggered by the same Event. In that case, the Rules will be run
// in the order in which they were defined. Rules do not have to have
// EventSelectors, but only rules with EventSelectors will be invoked
// directly in response to an incoming Event.
//
// Matchers: A list of objects that the Engine uses to determine
// whether this Rule should take action in response to an incoming
// Event.  Each object ahould have a single key with the name of the
// Matcher, and a value specific to that Matcher. Currently, the
// Engine knows about the following Matchers:
//
// "And" and "Or", which expect their values to be arrays of key-value
// pairs that can be compiled by ResolveMatch.  "And" will match if
// all of its matchers match, and "Or" will match if any of its
// matchers match.  Both operators will only execute enough of their
// matchers to determine if the overall matcher will succeed (for
// "Or"), or fail (for "And").  If no matchers are passed, "And" will
// signal that it matched, and "Or" will signal that it did not match.
//
//
// "Not", which expects its value to be a single key-value pair that
// can be compiled by ResolveMatcher.  "Not" will invert the return
// value of its matcher.
//
//
// "Enabled", which expects its value to be a bool.  It will return
// the value of that boolean without change, and (as the name
// suggests) is expected to enable and disable rules for testing
// purposes.
//
//
// "JSON", which expects a struct with the following format:
//   struct {
//		Selector    string
//		SaveAs      string
//		PickResults map[string]float64
//	 }
//
// "Selector" is a string containing a JSON Selector matching the
// specification at http://jsonselect.org/#overview.  The selector
// will return an array of results containing each individual item
// from the RunContext that was passed into the Matcher.
//
// "SaveAs" is an optional variable name to save the results the
// selector returned.  The entire array of results will be saved, even
// if it is only one element long.
//
// "PickResults" is an optional map of variables names to selector
// indexes.  After the selector returns its results and they have been
// optionally saved to the variable pointed to by SaveAs, PickResults
// will save data from the selector indexes to the matching variable
// names.  If the selector results do not contain a requested index,
// then the match will fail with an error.  You should construct
// Selector and PickResults with that in mind.  In the absence of
// PickResults, a JSON match fails if nothing was selected or the
// Selector was invalid, otherwise it passes.
//
//
// "Script", which expects its value to be a string that will be
// parsed using text.Template.  The result of that parsing should be a
// valid bash script.  When the Matcher is ran, the parsed script will
// be compiled using the passed RunContext.  If the compilation fails,
// the match will fail with an error, so be sure to write your scripts
// with that in mind.  Otherwise, the matcher will pass if the script
// exits with a zero and fail otherwise.
//
//
// "Eq", "Ne", "Lt", "Le", "Gt", "Ge", which are basic 2-item
// comparison functions that expect a 2 element array of values.  If
// the value is a string that begins with '$', the string will be
// interpreted as the name of a variable.  If that variable has been
// set, its value will be substituted.  To use a literal string
// beginning with $, escape it with a \.  To begin with a literal \,
// escape it with \\.
//
//
// "Len", which expects its value to be a struct with the following
// format:
//
//    struct {
//        Var string
//        SaveAs string
//    }
//
// If the variable saved in Var is something with a length (an array,
// a map, or a string), the matcher will return true and save the
// length of the variable in the variable named by SaveAs, otherwise
// it will return false.
//
//
// "UUID", which expects its value to be a struct matching the
// following format:
//
//    struct {
//        Node string
//        Role string
//        Deployment string
//        NodeRole string
//        DeploymentRole string
//        SaveAs string
//    }
//
// Out if those fields, exactly one of Node, Role, Deployment,
// NodeRole, and DeploymentRole should be filled, and their values must
// resolve to an existing object of their type, otherwise the matcher will not match.
//If there is such an object, its UUID will be saved in SaveAs.
//
//
// "GetAttrib", which expects its value to be a struct with the following format:
//
//    struct {
//        Attrib string
//        Node string
//        Role string
//        Deployment string
//        NodeRole string
//        DeploymentRole string
//        SaveAs string
//    }
//
//
// Out if those fields, exactly one of Node, Role, Deployment,
// NodeRole, and DeploymentRole should be filled, and their values
// must resolve to an existing object of their type, otherwise the
// matcher will not match.  Attrib must also be filled with the name
// of the Attrib to fetch.  If the vlue of the attrib can be fetched
// for the object, it will be saved in the variable named by SaveAs
//
//
// Actions:  a list of objects that define what this Rule should do if it Matches.
// Each object should have a single key/value pair, the key of which is the name
// of the Action to perform and the value of which is specific to each Action.
// The Engine currently understands the following Actions:
//
// "Log", which causes the engine to emit a hard-coded logging message
// to stderr.  This is mainly for testing purposes so far, but we may
// repurpose it to emit something useful later.
//
//
// "Script", which expects its value to be a string that will be
// parsed using text.Template.  The result of that parsing should be a
// valid bash script.  When the Action is ran, the parsed script will
// be compiled using the passed RunContext.  If the compilation fails,
// or the resultant script executes with a non-zero exit status, the
// Action will fail, otherwise it will pass.
//
//
// "Delay", which expects its value to be the number of seconds to
// pause for before performing the next Action.
//
//
// "Bind, which expects its value to be a struct matching the following format:
//    struct {
//        NodeID string
//        DeploymentID string
//        RoleID string
//        SaveAs string
//    }
// Exactly 2 of the ID fields must be filled, and which two determine what action Bind will take.
//
// "NodeID" and "RoleID": a Role will be bound to a Node
//
// "NodeID" and "DeploymentID": a Node will be moved into a new Deployment
//
// "RoleID" and "DeploymentID": a Role will be bound to a Deployment
//
// If "SaveAs is set, the resultant new object's unique identifier (if
// one was created) will be saved in the referenced variable
//
//
// "Retry", which causes a node role to be retried.
//    struct {
//        NodeRoleID string
//    }
// This causes the node role to be retried.
//
//
// "SetAttrib", which expects its value to be a struct wuth the following format:
//
//    struct {
//        Attrib string
//        Node string
//        Deployment string
//        NodeRole string
//        DeploymentRole string
//        Value interface{}
//    }
//
//
// Out if those fields, exactly one of Node, Role, Deployment,
// NodeRole, and DeploymentRole should be filled, and their values
// must resolve to an existing object of their type, otherwise the
// action will fail.  Attrib must be the name of the attribute to set,
// and Value must be tbe value you want to set the attrib to for the
// object.
//
//
// "Commit", which expects its value to be a struct with the following format:
//
//    struct {
//        NodeID: string
//        DeploymentID: string
//        DeploymentRoleID: string
//        NodeRoleID: string
//    }
//
// Exactly one of those fields must contain the name or UUID of the thing to be committed,
// and the thing will be committed.
//
//
// "Stop", which takes a boolean value which is ignored.  Stop tells
// the RunContext to stop processing Rules for this event,
// effeectively making the current Rule the last in the chain of Rules
// the RunContext would process for the list of Rules the RunContext
// was created to process.
//
//
// "Jump", which takes a string value naming the Rule in the RuleSet
// to jump to after the current Rule has finished processing.  Jumps
// must be forward -- the rule you wish to jump to must appear in the
// list of Rules for the RuleSet after the currently executing Rule.
//
//
// "Call", which behaves like (and has the same restrictions as) Jump,
// except that the RunContext will return control to the Rule defined
// after the currently executing one if it encounters a Return action.
//
//
// "Return" behaves like Stop if there has been no Call action,
// otherwise it returns control to the Rule immediately after the one
// that had the most recent Call action.
