// Deployments are the main tool that Rebar provides to group
// related nodes together.  They carry Deployment-specific
// configuration information (in the form of DeploymentRoles), Nodes
// (a node belongs to exactly one Deployment at any given point in
// time), and NodeRoles (NodeRoles remember which Deployment they were
// first committed in, and always use that when calculating the attrib
// data to be passed in to a run).
//
// Deployments are structured as a tree with the system deployment at
// the root.  All newly-discovered Nodes start in the system
// deployment, where they have their inital set of Roles bound to
// them.
//
// Deployment satisfies the Attriber interface.  GetAttrib and
// SetAttrib calls on a Deployment will be redirected to the
// appropriate DeploymentRole in this Deployment.
