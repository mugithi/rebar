// Attrib encapsualtes the concept of per-thing user settable
// parameters that can be overridden in a generic fashion. The way it
// works is like this:
//
// Each thing that can hold Attribs (which in this API is anything
// that implements the Attriber interface) has 2 to 5 buckets that
// values can be stored in. Each bucket is implemented on the server
// side as a large JSON blob that holds the Attrib values.  This
// implementation is likely to change, so this API does not expose
// access to the buckets directly.
//
// The first bucket (and the only one that this API can write to) is
// the proposed bucket.  Updating the value of an Attrib via the API
// or the UI writes the value into this bucket unless otherwise
// indicated, and the annealer ignores attrib values from the proposed
// bucket.
//
// The second bucket is the committed bucket. After you have made
// whatever changes you want to the attribs of an Attriber, the
// proposed bucket is copied over to the committed bucket.
//
// The third bucket is the system bucket.  This bucket contains
// information that the Rebar framework maintains internally for the
// logic that the Roles implement to use.
//
// The fourth bucket is the wall.  It contains the values of attribs
// that are updated as a consequence of a Role being run against a
// Node
//
// The fifth bucket is the notes.  Notes do not participate in the
// annealing process, and are inteded to be used by users for
// attaching arbitrary data that they need to remember but that
// Rebar does not need to care about.
//
// Additionally, each Attrib has a default value, which is used if
// there is no Attrib value from any of the other buckets.
//
// Not all Attribers have all of these buckets.
